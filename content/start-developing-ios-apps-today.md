Someone at Apple understands that developers drive a platform. Of course, it&apos;s not exceedingly easy to get started developing for the iPhone though it does become apparent that there&apos;s a ton of code from which to draw inspiration and answers once you have a basic grasp of the language and SDK components.

Enter the Apple&apos;s new basic development tutorial. It&apos;ll take you through all the necessary steps for making an application, linking to some more thorough documents that you can tackle one at a time. Great for the aspiring developer.
