Good day, blog friends!

Not counting [Muniverse](http://blog.nickoneill.name/muniverse-2.html) (and I don't, it was waiting to be published for a while), it has been quite a time since I last wrote a thing. Here's some stuff that doesn't warrant its own post:

Brad and I finally finished a remote garage door opener based on an Arduino and WiFly. See the incredible frustration documented on G+ [here](https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/2PSkLbtUJRB) and [here](https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/WCen2ZJE9vz). A few more tweaks and the whole thing will be on github.

I'm doing some more frequent science tweeting with [@finestructure](https://twitter.com/finestructure). I never realized I felt a little trapped in my regular twitter account, I'm not an oversharer and I don't like to innundate my friends with dumb stuff. Strangers, on the other hand, love dumb stuff. Seriously though, it's full of excellent science and snark.

I want to get back to blogging more on the proper Fine Structure blog but I'm frustrated with my publishing setup there. I want to adapt [my dropbox static publisher](https://github.com/nickoneill/go-publisher) for this purpose but it requires some thinking, generalizing and coding. Maybe during vacation, or after I write some content.

Work continues to be enjoyable. There are many ways to run a small contracting business and my current method involves doing enough directly billable work to be comfortable and then investing the rest of my time in learning new things - not always directly related to work. I don't think I could ever swing a deal like that at a standard salaried job so I think I'll be doing this for a while.

I'm spending a bit of time playing [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) (as little time as someone can spend and still improve in the Most Complex Game Ever). I tend to leave it alone for a few weeks then see something that inspires me to start a new fort, play that for a few days and get totally destroyed by a seige of undead. Such is life in the DF. I would very much like to try a Let's Play video for DF so we'll see where that idea goes in the next few weeks.

I started writing about my current reading list here but it ran far too long, that will have to come at a later date. Welcome back, blog!
