Here's a [pretty awesome photo](http://a.yfrog.com/img515/4024/5k4p.jpg) from last night's rare thunderstorm in San Francisco. It shows lightning simultaneously striking all four western span towers of the Bay Bridge.

Mother Nature: more like this, plz!

**Update:** [Another shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/philmcgrew/6926707884/) of the same thing!
