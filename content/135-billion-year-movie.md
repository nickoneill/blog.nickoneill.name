This [youtube video from NASA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ssc1GsqHds) shows a galactic simulation for approximately 13.5 Billion years. While watching galaxies tear each other apart is fun and all, the fascinating part is that it is, after all, a simulation.

Take some physical rules and enough processing power and you can simulate 13.5 Billion years of dust coming together which in turn attracts more dust and creates stars which attracts more dust which creates young stars whichâ€¦ you get the idea.
