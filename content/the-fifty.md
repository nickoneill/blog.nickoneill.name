Yes, they make 50 thousand ton presses. They&apos;re used for making all sorts of parts that you don&apos;t want to welt or bolt together. This particular machine was built in 1955 and its relevance is impressive:

&gt;Every manned U.S. military aircraft now flying uses parts forged by the Fifty. So does every commercial aircraft made by Airbus and Boeing.

How many other commercial machines built in 1955 are still in use today, let alone being used for some of the most cutting edge machines?

I love giant machines like this one because they stand as large and imposing as a particle accelerator but in a totally different context.
