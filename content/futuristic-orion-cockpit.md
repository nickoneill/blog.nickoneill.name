Someone at NASA clearly read my [issues with the SpaceX cockpit layout](http://blog.nickoneill.name/ux-for-the-spacex-dragon/) while [designing the Orion capsule](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/americas-next-spaceship-180952126/). Note the easy to reach joystick and lack of information overload on the screens!

Seriously though, it's interesting how similar the SpaceX and Orion configurations are. Just a few seats and a screen that folds down in front of your face!
