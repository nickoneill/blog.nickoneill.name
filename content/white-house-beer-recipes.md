I've been brewing beer at home since the spring so it was pretty cool to see the White House staff getting into brewing and then releasing their own [recipes for Honey Ale and Honey Porter](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe).

I'm tempted to pick up the ingredients for the porter and try it out - I'm sure the [Brewcraft store in SF](http://www.sanfranciscobrewcraft.com/) (where I get all my recipes) is getting plenty of requests for those ingredients. So far I've made a Pale Ale (decent!), an Amber Ale (slightly watery), a Pilsner (tasty but slightly overcarbonated) and an IPA is almost ready to be bottled.

Echoing Sam Kass (White House assistant chef), it's surprisingly easy to make a really tasty beer at home. I would suggest two things if you're new to brewing: get the supplies to do primary and secondary fermentation and pay attention to your sanitization. Transfering to a second container after a few days will get your beer off the dead yeast which can give off weird flavors (there are simple brewing methods that use a single container for all fermentation before the bottle). Keeping equipment sanitized through the entire process is not hard but you have to pay attention to what tools are in a clean state and only use those on your clean equipment (or resanitize them). Wild yeasts and bacteria are everywhere and a batch of fermenting beer can be a pretty ideal place for unpleasant things to grow.

Go forth and brew White House beer!
