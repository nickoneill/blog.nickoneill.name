Hooray! It&apos;s inside baseball for anyone who doesn&apos;t use Objective-C on a regular basis but one of those nitpicky issues is finally being fixed in a new clang version: literals for NSNumber, NSArray and NSDictionary!

The syntax looks sane and concise, I&apos;m totally psyched to use it. Also, bonus feature: sane accessors without using `objectAtIndex:` or `objectForKey:`!
