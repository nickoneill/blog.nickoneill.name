The author of [this new scientist article](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328501.600-zap-your-brain-into-the-zone-fast-track-to-pure-focus.html) on using transcranial direct current stimulation to boost focus when learning decided to write a bit more on her experiences when testing the equipment:

> I only remember feeling like I had just had an excellent cup of coffee, but without the caffeine jitters. I felt clear-headed and like myself, just sharper. Calmer. Without fear and without doubt. From there on, I just spent the time waiting for a problem to appear so that I could solve it.

I don&apos;t know a single geek who hasn&apos;t wanted this. Geek life is all about learning new things constantly and developing the talents to tune out all the noise is a part of the process. I would pay handsomely to be able to push a button to get into the zone on an otherwise noisy day.
