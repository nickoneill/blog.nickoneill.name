The kind of data that Stephen Wolfram collects about himself is absolutely mind-boggling. Here he writes a post about data he&apos;s collected, most of it dating back to the early 90s.

I wonder what kind of time he spends getting the systems in place to log, for example, every keystroke he&apos;s ever typed. I like to look back on data and note interesting events and patterns that mean something but I wouldn&apos;t spend any measure of time to set something up for a few extra data points down the road. His blog post doesn&apos;t come any closer to explaining his reasoning for logging everything or what he gets out of it, but I assume it&apos;s something that he enjoys given the amount of effort put in.
