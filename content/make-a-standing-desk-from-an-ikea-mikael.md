Standing desks are gaining popularity with the nerds who realize that their former sit-all-day behavior might be detrimental to their long-term health. I'm no exception to that realization but I wasn't about to go out and buy a new desk without knowing how I'd feel standing all day. Luckily my desk was [cheapy simple mikael desk](http://www.google.com/images?q=ikea+mikael+desk) from Ikea that had lots of hack potential. This is definitely inspired by [Gina's switcher post](http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk) earlier this year as well.

Before doing any hacking though, I had to figure out just how high I wanted my desk surface. A couple books topped with a cutting board later, I found something pretty comfortable for me. I actually tried to look up a "best height" for typing at a standing desk but I couldn't find any data to this effect. I ended up somewhere that felt comfortable, with my arms roughly resting at my sides.

I thought up a quick way to non-destructively prop my desk up another 11.5 inches with some 2x4s. Here's a photo of the end result:

Some details: two 20" pieces of 2x4 are connected at the bottom by a slice of 2x4 about as thick as a the desk sides (1"3/8). The sides sit on four of these legs, supported 11.5" above the floor by a bolt that sits in two holes on either side of the leg. Nothing is drilled through the desk itself, it just sits on top. The bolts are tightened to hold the sides of the desk and the whole thing is surprisingly sturdy. Here's some detail of a single leg:

I've spent about 3 days working at the desk so far and I enjoy it quite a bit. It's nice to be able to fidget and move about when you're working. My feet hurt a bit but some well-supported shoes did a lot to help that out. I imagine that it'll feel better after a week or so of standing up as well. One downside is that the cats have no lap to sit on.

I haven't adjusted any of my monitors to eye-level as I'm not convinced it's necessary. I don't feel that I strain to look down at my displays so it hasn't bothered me yet.

One thing I didn't anticipate changing: Before the standing desk, I tended to get up in the mornings, grab some cereal and sit down at the computer and check emails or news. Now I'm less likely to want to stand at my desk right away so I can sit in the kitchen and eat something without refreshing facebook. It never quite felt like a compulsion but I'm glad I'm doing something else first thing in the morning.

Hopefully I'll remember to follow up to this post in a week or two. Ideally my feet will stop hurting entirely in another day or two, but the last couple days have been fairly busy with stuff to do away from the desk so it'll be interesting to see how a full day of typing feels in the coming week.

*Update 3/28:* Hey, I stand all day now and it's pretty OK. Zero pain in my legs or back since about two weeks after I started standing, which was the only real downside. I did end up adjusting a monitor a bit closer to eye-level after a couple long days with few breaks left my neck hurting. I'm still enjoying it!
