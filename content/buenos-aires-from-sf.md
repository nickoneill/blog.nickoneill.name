description: "Some tips and reviews for staying in Buenos Aires"
---
There are so many fascinating cultural details from far away places that I think about when I'm traveling and it seems that I always forget to write about them when I return. So I took some notes this time while I was away and this is my attempt at turning those into a cohesive post.

We frequented the hip neighborhoods of Palermo Viejo/Soho which are more comparable to the Mission or Nopa area than the upscale places you can find in Recoletta or the Financial District. Keep this in mind when reading prices as there are definitely places to go for both cheaper and more expensive fare.

Foursquare was sometimes useful but often inaccurate in details. I've added tips, improved listings and included some of the best places we went to in this post. 

### transportation

Aeromexico was the cheapest option at the time of booking. Roughly a 4 hour flight down to Mexico City on a plainly equipped 737, then a couple-hour layover and another 9 hours to Buenos Aires on a much more comfortable 777. The flights down were smooth and uneventful, though we did have to swap planes on the way back through MEX.

{{% aside %}}I was slightly concerned about storms in the [Intertropical Convergence Zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone) but we didn't hit any unusual weather{{% /aside %}}

Laying over in Mexico City, however, was a complete mess. I've been able to get through international layovers without much problem previously (as long as the immigration lines aren't too long) but Mexico City forces you to retrieve your checked luggage and recheck it to your destination (presumably some sort of drug enforcement security measure). This took literally two hours in either direction. Perhaps this is planned into the layover times or I just happened to get lucky but it seems like an easy way to miss your connecting flight is to layover in MEX.

We planned ahead for a cab from the airport to take us into Buenos Aires though it was apparent when we arrived that it wasn't necessary, lots of cabs waiting just outside to take you into town. One benefit of booking beforehand is that we were able to find a driver who would take dollars since we didn't exchange money at the airport (more on this in a bit). It was a flat $30 into the Palermo neighborhood which isn't exactly close to the highway that runs to the airport. The ride back was a$300 (Argentine pesos, for the purpose of distinguishing) which we heard was pretty standard when asking around.

{{% aside %}}And yes, the word is [Argentine, not Argentinian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Argentine,_not_Argentinian){{% /aside %}}

Do not expect to drive in the city unless you are very familiar with the cultural rules of the road. Stop signs, when installed, are rarely adhered to. Instead, most small intersections are governed by what seems like a giant game of chicken. The most ballsy driver is the one who crosses the intersection and the opposite direction waits until traffic in the other direction has slowed, or until they've slowly creeped into the middle of the street and won their game of chicken. Cars generally pay attention to red lights and busy intersections have pedestrian crossing signals as well.

{{% aside %}}Traffic lights in Buenos Aires actually turn yellow between red and green as well, presumably to give cabbies a chance to gun it before everyone else{{% /aside %}}

On larger streets, lane markings are only useful as indication for how many cars may fit horizontally on a street. Cars, cabs and busses go to where there's an empty spot, regardless of the position of lanes.

Luckily, you don't really need to drive. Cabs are plentiful and cheap, which really highlights the flaws of the San Francisco cab system that allowed Uber and Lyft to pop up. A trip across town with some traffic in traffic is usually no more than a$100, plenty of closer locations are under a$50. Make sure your driver puts the meter on.

{{% aside %}}You probably won't need it, but you can request a cab with [Easy Taxi](http://www.easytaxi.com/) from your phone{{% /aside %}}

Pedestrians are an afterthought. Cars won't slow down to let you  cross if you wait at the corner. You have to just walk and make it across before they reach you, or you'll be warned that you're in the way with a honk.

Bikes are surprisingly well supported in such a car-centric city ([widest avenue in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_de_Julio_Avenue) and all) with a network of separated bike lanes that usually run on smaller roads parallel to arterials. There's also a network of free yellow city bikes that you can take around the city, though I didn't experience this myself. Bikes, obviously, yield to cars at intersections.

### the peso and the dollar

About the Argentine peso: in the 90s it was pegged to the dollar but that fell out of favor during the 2001 crash and the subsequent uncoupling of the peso led to inflation and general instability. The government proceeded to fight against inflation over the course of the next few years, finally settling on restricting the flow of dollars into the country in 2011.

Naturally, restricting the supply didn't stem the demand for the relatively stable dollar and the alternative "blue" rate sprung up, giving a gray market method for Argentines to get dollars which they need for major purchases like apartments. When the government again devalued the peso in early 2014 the blue rate really spiked and it's been somewhere between 13.5 and 15.5 for the last few months that I've been paying attention.

The official rate has hovered around 8.5 so the blue rate during some periods has almost given you twice as many pesos per dollar. We were relatively lucky, arriving when the rate was close to 15 and exchanging enough for our first week. Subsequent exchanges for the second week were at roughly 14 and 13 and the rate is about 13.5 today.

There are plenty of other sites telling you how to find places to change dollars into pesos at the blue rate, I won't go into detail here.

### a short diversion on Argentine history

Buenos Aires feels like a city that hasn't had much cohesive government direction and that plays out if you look at the history of government in Argentina. The [Argentine history wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Argentina) is long list of government control swaps on a roughly ten year schedule that isn't just two parties going back and forth. Since 1900, Argentina has had conservatives, military rule, socialists and what seems like everything in between, separated by revolution, riot and coup d'Ã©tat.

The government has been a relatively stable democracy since the early 80s but the economy hasn't been so kind. 

The most glaring proof of this is the incredible architecture of the public buildings that are 50+ years old but obviously in a state of deterioration.

We heard from others about certain government restrictions that make no sense for an economy struggling to grow - no commercial import or export of alcohol for one - so I suspect that the government must think there are more important issues to deal with.

### purchasing

If you're traveling here, major costs will most likely be in dollars, apartment rentals included. In that sense, Buenos Aires isn't all that cheap. However, for incidental costs paid in pesos the exchange rate makes it somewhere between a very and an absurdly cheap place to live.

Consider this: cocktails in San Francisco are never less than $10 and usually somewhere between $14 and $20. In Buenos Aires, you are unlikely to see a cocktail above a$100 (or as we frequently estimated, $7 at the blue rate).

We ate out for most meals - unusual for us, but vacation! - and generally spent a$50-75 for a plate and maybe another a$50 for a drink. Generally under a$300 for two people per meal which we felt was quite cheap.

In fact, I find myself balking at the prices in San Francisco upon our return. It's not uncommon to sit down for a quick meal and end up with a $50 bill here so I'm glad we're back to cooking at home as well.

There are a lot of boutique-y clothes places in Palermo Viejo, so you can do some shopping while you're there. I got a couple tshirts and a hoodie (a "large") for a$550 from various places, there are some very fancy fashion places in the neighborhood around [Plaza Serrano](https://foursquare.com/v/feria-de-plaza-serrano/4e2c3c16ae605c533a3fc1a0) also. The plaza also hosts a weekend street fair, some of which is out on Saturday but quite a bit more stuff on Sunday.

### drinks and food

While we're on the subject of food and drink...

Beer in Buenos Aires was not very good in general. You can get Quilmes - either the standard Crystal or other labels that tasted very similar - essentially anywhere and usually in 1 liter bottles. It's the equivalent to cheap, light beer in the US. Various other local beers (and Heineken) in similar formats and tastes for around a$50 at the supermarket and similar prices for something on tap at a bar or restaurant.

There are a couple microbreweries in Buenos Aires that are very popular but again, the style is very light beer, regardless of actual beer style. I *did* have a bottled [OtroMundo Strong Red](http://www.otromundo.com/eng/strong-red-ale.html) that was very good but I only found it in one restaurant.

Wine is pretty incredible, plentiful and very cheap. Malbec is the style that Argentina is known for and it shows as 80% of the wine selection is just that. But it's quite good and usually around a$100 for a mid-range bottle. We developed a nice 5pm wine habit while we were there.

We ended up stopping into a wine shop near where we were staying and getting about 16 bottles to bring back with us. Due to the excellent packing skills of the guys at [Almacen Sabor Regional](https://foursquare.com/v/almacen-sabor-regional/518b2f94498ef1c5ea6b631d), all of them made it back intact.

As expected, the food was overwhelmingly meaty. There were a few vegetarian restaurants in Palermo Viejo/Hollywood but you are mostly limited to meat in large quantities. 

If you never had the opportunity to try a fancy 12-course molecular gastronomy-style meal with wine pairings, maybe the exchange rate here will convince you to give it a shot. We went to [Aramburu](https://foursquare.com/v/aramburu/4c5cc3a385a1e21ef7c45711) which, while the style was fascinating, wasn't nearly the best food we ate while in Buenos Aires.

As for more local fare, [NOLA](https://foursquare.com/v/nola-buenos-aires-buenos-aires/501e614de4b075c1f08ac141) has an incredible fried chicken sandwich and their other New Orleans-inspired items are super tasty. Plus the house beer, [BrÃ¶eders](http://broedersartesanal.com/), is pretty good.
