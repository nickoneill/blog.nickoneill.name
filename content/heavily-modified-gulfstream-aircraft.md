Among some of the weirder modifications done to Gulfstream planes were the changes for [Shuttle Training Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Training_Aircraft), a G-II that was used to simulate landings before astronauts jumped into the Shuttle itself.

> Shuttle approaches were so steep — 20 degrees! — that the jets had to be operated with the main landing gear down and both Spey engines running *in reverse* at 92% N2.

**N2** is a measure of the rotational speed of the high-compression stage of the engine, so 92% reverse N2 is almost full throttle in the opposite direction!
