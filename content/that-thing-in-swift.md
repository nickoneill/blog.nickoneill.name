It took me a few weeks to get started but I've been working on a few projects in swift recently and my opinions have been ranging from "this is not very different that Obj-C" to "this is a vast improvement over Obj-C" depending on the task. I'd say that's pretty positive considering the age of the language.

I'm constantly wondering what the correct pattern or syntax for swift is given the equivalent way of doing things in Objective-C so I started a little blog where I collect the examples that I find. It's called [That thing in swift](http://thatthinginswift.com).

Yep, everyone is making blogs about swift and I am totally on the bandwagon. The book deal is obviously right around the corner.

Swift deserves a longer post about the language in general, which will probably be here eventually. I would suggest an even bigger blowout post about WWDC in general but we already know I won't sit down and write something that long.
