If you've got one of these GE Profile refrigerators from a few years ago (this one was installed around 2004, model *PSS26MSRD*) and the ice maker isn't making ice, there are a few simple steps you can go through to troubleshoot.

## issues with the icemaker itself

First, pull out the ice bin and eyeball the ice maker device behind it. See if the switch is turned on and the green light is lit. If it's blinking, that indicates "ice stuck in tray" and you'll have to take it out and thaw the whole contraption out. It's not that hard: unplug the giant molex connector on the right side and use a small hex wrench to unscrew the obvious screw holding it to the left side of the freezer wall. Then you can firmly pull the device up and out until it pops free from the notches where it sits in the back.

If there's ice stuck in the device, or if it's just not filling properly, let it sit out for a few hours until it warms up. Depending on the humidity conditions in your freezer, something could have frosted over.

## the swing arm

Check the swing arm on the bottom of the device. Despite the appearance as a bit of useless plastic, it has a magnet attached to an arm inside the main ice maker housing which allows the maker to tell if the arm is extended or pushed part ways in. Ice being make and pushed into the bucket depresses the swing arm when it falls and the arm returns to the extended position via a small spring mounted between it and the unit unless the ice maker is full. This spring has a habit of popping out of a tiny hole and not providing the force needed for the arm to return to "make more ice" position. Check that it pushes back at you if you depress it.

Hopefully one of these items you've checked wasn't working because they're all easy fixes. Reassemble and add it back to the freezer, making sure that the water dispenser in the back of the freezer leads INTO the ice maker, not BELOW it. This would cause a mess. Make sure the thing is plugged in again, and the green light is back on.

## restarting the ice maker quickly

If you're impatient about waiting for another ice cycle to start, depress the swing arm three times in a row. This should tell the ice maker to immediately dispense water and start a new cycle.

This information was only found in bits and pieces scattered around the corners of the internet so I join them together here for the betterment of refrigerator-using people everywhere. Go forth and make ice.
