This [animated TED talk]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcuIc5O-DE&feature=player_embedded) is actually about how pain *relievers* work but it explains the basis of pain as well, including some curious details that I didn't know.

George Zaidan (creator of the lesson, not the animator) finds a way to explain some fairly complicated biology without resorting to useless over simplications (it works by "blocking pain"!). I'll have to flip through more educational videos on [TED-ed](http://ed.ted.com/).
