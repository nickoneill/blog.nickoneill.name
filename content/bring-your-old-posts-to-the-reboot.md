I love this footnote from [Gina's blog reboot](http://scribbling.net/2013/09/11/reboot/):

> Several years ago, I took Scribbling.net's original archives down because they no longer represented me, and looking back at them embarrassed me, the way reading your diary from when you were a teenager would. Over time I hope to port selected essays back to the site for posterity.

This rings particularly true for me, as I have archives from various blogs dating back to 2000 when I *was* actually a teenager.

Most of that content is embarrassing personal stuff, I'm still amazed that I chose to put it online but relieved by the fact that no one but me really read that stuff in the first place. Unlike [some people](http://dashes.com/anil/1999/07/), we can't all be perfectly happy with things we wrote 10+ years ago.

There are a few gems, however. Mostly stuff about my thoughts when I first moved out to San Francisco that I'd like to hold on to (not that I couldn't hold on to it privately), but also some tech stuff I wrote about back then.

I like the idea of bringing selected posts back but doing it directly would probably be weird; a bunch of posts dating back to 2011 and then a smattering from 2004-5? Instead, I'll try to bring back the tech-related ones first with some thoughts on their context and what we've seen since then.

The more personal ones might take longer to form a commentary on but if a blog is supposed to tell the story of who we are, it's probably relevant to look back on a few important moments over the last ten years or so.
