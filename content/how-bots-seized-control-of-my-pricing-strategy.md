An interesting tale of Amazon pricing and used books that may or may not exist.

However, the more interesting fact is that there are Amazon bots that sell Markov Chain-generated books (titled about turing tests) for dumb prices. Do they make money? Someone must buy them and get confused about what it all means. Moneyquote:
