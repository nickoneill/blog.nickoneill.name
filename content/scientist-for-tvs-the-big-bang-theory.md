There was a lot of talk when TBBT first started playing about the accuracy of the science on the show, whiteboards included. Now you can read an interview with the Science Advisor to the show, David Saltzberg.

It&apos;s interesting both for how current physics developments make it onto the show
and for the general behind-the-scenes look at a sitcom in contrast to how it feels on TV.
