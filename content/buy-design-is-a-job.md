I haven't read *[Design Is a Job](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job)* yet but you should buy it if you have clients, even if you don't specifically do design.

When he can tear himself away from Twitter, Mike Monteiro does some really great work. In terms of work for *his* clients and when talking about his process on the [Mule Design Blog](http://weblog.muledesign.com/). And that's why I can recommend *Design Is a Job* without reading it.
