I'm used to seeing lots of predictions for which exoplanets might be in the habitable zone for which newly discovered solar system (less so nowâ€¦ [Kepler](http://blog.nickoneill.name/tags/kepler/) has identified so many of them people don't even bother anymore) but here's a best-case scenario: [A solar system filled to the brim with 60 habitable worlds](http://kottke.org/14/05/building-the-ultimate-solar-system) (and a bonus 4 gas giants)!

The system is really a combination of two systems in binary configuration (two suns orbiting each other at a distance of 100 AU). The first has six orbits of two planet pairs each, in [trojan configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(astronomy)). The second is a combination, four orbits with gas giants and five large moons a piece, plus trojan planet pairs on the Lagrange points.
