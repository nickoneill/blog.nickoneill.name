[In Time](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/) turned out to be a movie that relied far too heavily on making time puns. As for the plot, there are about a million ways one can make an interesting scifi storyline with immortality *and* time-as-currency but the writer/director managed to keep everything pretty shallow.

Speaking of, writing *and* directing a film seems like a Lucas-esque control freak move. You're the best writer you could convince to do your movie? Unlikely. And the best director? These odds are not getting better. Don't even get me started on people who write/direct/star.

I'm a fan of Matt Bomer on *White Collar* so I was disappointed by his lack of screen time. He may have been the only character in the entire film with clear motivations, though that may have been simply a side effect of being a chracter who dies early.

In conclusion, do not watch.
