I also thought being a C Corp prevented directors from persuing goals outside of the realm of shareholder value so it's great to hear that this [is not the case](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/05/13/benefit-corporations-vs-regular-corporations-a-harmful-dichotomy/):

> The problem is that its primary rationale rests on the mistaken, though widely-held, premise that existing law prevents boards of directors from considering the impact of corporate decisions on other stakeholders, the environment or society at large.

Considering this... are B Corp organizations done just as show of support? Otherwise I hardly see the point.
