There's something about this [tiny, open source printer](http://gofreerange.com/hello-printer) that makes me think about non-digital communication in a positive way, which is a somewhat rare occurrence. Something about the way it's designed and how nicely the print quality isâ€¦ and the simplicity of it all.

Also, when I said "open source" I really meant it. [You build the printer](https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Making-your-own-printer).
