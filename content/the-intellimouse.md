Ah, [the IntelliMouse]( http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/18/3155619/microsoft-intellimouse-status-symbols )! It was simply the best mouse at the time, and I used one for a long time despite those being some of my prime Microsoft-hating years.

It doesn't matter what people think of you when you create something so much better than the competition.
