Yes, we'll be getting [our own Shuttle flyover](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/sep/HQ_M12-173_Endeavour_Ferry_Flight.html)!

September 20th will see flyovers of Moffet Field, Sacramento and San Francisco on the way to Endeavour's final resting place at the space center in LA. Expect some awesome shots of the Golden Gate Bridge!
