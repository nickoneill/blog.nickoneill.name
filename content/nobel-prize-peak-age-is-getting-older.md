As I head ever closer to 30 this year I'm looking for any excuse to believe that your 20s are *not* the most creative or productive time in a person's life. Now I'm hearing that the [average Nobel Prize age is well into the late 30s](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/big-breakthroughs-come-in-your-late-30s/283858/) and pushing later for non-abstract fields. Though I'm not currently trying for a Nobel Prize, it's a positive note.

But everyone has always said that younger people have quantifiably better responses on cognitive function tests! Turns out this measurement may not the whole picture, there are interesting new results that suggest [measuring on speed alone is a poor indicator of a good answer](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/statistical-life/201401/the-myth-age-related-cognitive-decline).

Yes, you young people may be answering your questions faster but we're answering them *better*. Get off my lawn.
