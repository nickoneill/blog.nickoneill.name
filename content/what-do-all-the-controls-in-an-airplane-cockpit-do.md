A completely amazing answer about every single control in the cockpit of a 737. For all my dislike of Quora and its insular tech-centric postings, posts like this really make up for it.

The answerer (&quot;Tim Morgan&quot;) covers the controls through some well-placed screenshots from a detailed flight simulator. It explains both the incredible sophistication of these planes and the mind-numbing detail pilots must know these systems by. For example:

> Below the IRS panel are some warning lights showing when an IRU has failed, or is on battery backup power, and a pair of knobs that set the left and right IRU mode.  IRUs have to spin up and align before they can be used for navigation, a process that takes 10 minutes.  So the IRU must first be put into ALIGN mode for 10 minutes or so before it can be moved into NAV mode.  If the pilot is in a hurry, he can put the IRU into the emergency ATT (attitude-only) mode, but he will get no position information and only attitude information.
