Ok, this is mostly me just trying out [crossposting to Fine Structure](http://www.finestructure.com/2013/09/jurassic-park-nope/), but you've got to admit a little part of your ten year-old self just died a bit:

> Researchers studying insects from sub-fossilized fragments of copal, an amber-like resin, extracted remains of stingless bees trapped around 10,000 years ago and attempted to analyze DNA fragments found within. A few very short base pair chains matched parts from an asian bumblebee and some bacteria but nothing significant, the DNA has long since decayed and this is only after a short (geological) time.
