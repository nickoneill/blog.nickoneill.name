It's one thing to know that there are actors inside some of the raptors in Jurassic Park. It's quite another thing to see the process of creating the suits and characters themselves.

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAzQr3Ml0UI#!) and [post](https://www.stanwinstonschool.com/blog/jurassic-park-evolution-of-a-raptor-suit) from Stan Winston school of character arts (who knew!) show the whole behind-the-scenes process for creating the raptor. It's incredibly fascinating to watch the movements of the actor go from unfamiliar and jerky to something entirely convincing near the end. He can even play tug of war while being stuffed into the bottom of that suit!
