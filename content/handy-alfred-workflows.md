I love [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (well, quicksilver then launchbar now alfred) for launching apps and doing small calculations but I was reluctant to use it for other tasks for some reason. Slowly I started replacing some common tasks with Alfred actions, first finding albums to play on iTunes and then making [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) entries on the fly.

I don't pick up new alfred workflows too often because they can be very dependent on your own personal workflow; a lot of other people's workflows don't really fit with how I work. Plus lots of other apps have keyboard shortcuts of their own. Alfred is great for tasks where you can quickly navigate a few lists to find an item or forward some text input to another app quickly - usually chrome for searches.

So I was surprised when I found [a few programming workflows](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows) that  fit nicely into my routine. I picked up the package manager (I always open a new terminal window to install from brew or npm), the color converter (constantly converting between these formats for web work), and github (navigating a shallow set of lists!) and stackoverflow search.
