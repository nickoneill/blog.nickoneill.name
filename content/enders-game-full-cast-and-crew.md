The cast list is out for 2013s -biggest disappointment- best movie, the film interpretation of Ender&apos;s Game. And get this: *Harrison Ford* as *Graff*.

Otherwise mostly unknowns since it features a bunch of kids. That kid from *Hugo* as Ender is spot on, otherwise no one is really as I pictured them. Or I simply never had a very good idea of what anyone looked like.

Also, the headshots that kids do for acting are fucking creepy.
