Two of my favorite subreddits are Ask Science and Explain Like I'm Five because of the frequent awesome answers from people who actually know what they're talking about (on the internet! I know!).

If you've been hearing more hubbub about Obamacare recently but don't really know how the changes to insurance will effect you, [this is a great summary](http://www.reddit.com/tb/vbkfm) from someone answering a question on Explain Like I'm 5. It's definitely biased towards the legislation being a positive change but it also doesn't hide the potentially negative points. Make your own opinion!
