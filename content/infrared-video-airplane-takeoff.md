Infrared video is starting to come to the masses with devices like the FLIR camera but this is a completely different level.

I love the way the tarmac heats up behind the engines! That's one of those details you never think about because you (obviously) can't see in IR.

(the takeoff starts at 5:00 in the above video, embedding doesn't want to take my start time parameter today)

You can pretty clearly see normal striations in the skin of the jet. I wonder if a stationary system like this at airports could monitor for defects or weaknesses in aircraft skin? That sort of thing can be [pretty dangerous](http://avherald.com/h?article=43a4ac26&opt=1).
