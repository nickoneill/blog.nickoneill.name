1000 frames per second of an owl about to snatch something after swooping in. I love watching all the intricate movements and the resulting effects on the owl&apos;s position. Watch his head too, it stays very consistent despite all the movement going on around it.

Why can&apos;t we have mechanical objects with such complexity and grace?
