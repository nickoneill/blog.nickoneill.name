Jesse Thorn (I think I&apos;ve mentioned [Put This On](http://putthison.com/) before but he can adequately be described as a public radio nerd regardless of if you&apos;ve heard him before) write about *things* - methods, outlooks, etc - that you should do to Make Your Thing. They&apos;re all great notes about specific people who are successful at doing what they care about.

Being Jesse Thorn must be really fascinating. He&apos;s one of these people that is involved random projects from all over. Every time I find a new interesting internet show or podcast there&apos;s a good 50/50 chance that Jesse has had a hand in it. He&apos;s also had a radio show since he was 19 - the same one, albeit with a slightly different name or content - and that takes some enviable dedication to have done something for eleven years straight. I wonder what kind of inspiration he had growing up to develop such awesome habits.
