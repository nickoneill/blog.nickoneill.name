An oldie but goodie about Failure-Learning loops.

The critical part of this article (and why it feels more concrete than other social science based discussions on learning) is the identification of error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) activity in the brain. Researchers can actually tell if you&apos;re making mistakes and simply giving up or making an effort to learn from your mistake.

My favorite part from the article:

> After the children finished the test, the researchers told the students their score, and provided them with a single line of praise. Half of the kids were praised for their intelligence. “You must be smart at this,” the researcher said. The other students were praised for their effort: “You must have worked really hard.”

After this, the kids were offered a second test with the choice of harder or easier questions:

> When kids were praised for their effort, nearly 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. However, when kids were praised for their intelligence, most of them went for the easier test.

So not only can we tell if someone isn&apos;t making mistakes positively, we can influence their learning so that they make better choices and learn from their mistakes in the future!

It fits nicely with my own personal theory: there are no *smart* people or *dumb* people, there are people who do smart things and people who do dumb things.
