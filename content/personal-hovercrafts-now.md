I don't think I know anyone who wouldn't want to drive to work on their [personal hovercraft](http://boingboing.net/2012/08/24/testing-out-a-star-wars-style.html). It seems completely possible and this same group has released a number of videos showing their progress making the thing, so probably not a hoax.

It seems like this is one area where Hollywood has really understood how these things will behave according to the laws of physics. You'll be surprised at the intuitiveness of how the hoverbike behaves when turning and stopping.
