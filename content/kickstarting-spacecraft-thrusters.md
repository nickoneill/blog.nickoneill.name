Wanna back something novel on Kickstarter? [HyperV](http://www.hyperv.com/) is attempting to raise funds to develop [plasma jet thrusters](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027072188/plasma-jet-electric-thrusters-for-spacecraft) that could be used in spacecraft outside of the atmosphere.

It's not exactly citizen science (which I'd like to see on Kickstarter some day) but it's a great start if you want to be involved with funding an awesome science and technology project and get interesting updates along the way.

Ignore their standard science company website and the slightly awkward funding video and back their awesome project today!

Update: They were successful! They've done a really great job of keeping backers up-to-date on the project so far, I think this is a great model for science on Kickstarter.
