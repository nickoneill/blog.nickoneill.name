Ah, more dystopian future movies. Not quite a remake of 1990&apos;s *Total Recall* and possibly more closely based on Dick&apos;s *We Can Remember It for You Wholesale*.

There are just too many awesome ways to go with the memory implantation theme, this particular story deals with being able to completely wipe and implant memories, of course. Believe it or not, I&apos;m not sick of the what-is-real-and-what-is-not theme that&apos;s been ridden so hard for the last ten years. Is there some unspoken rule where movies dealing with reality must be good? Keep &apos;em coming.

The second theme that is noticeable (and enjoyable) is how Quaid (played by Colin Farrell) is subconsciously alerted to his condition by strange and violent dreams. Mother nature is able to subvert even the most complex human technology. I wonder if this theme will play out in the end of the film or if they&apos;ll stick with the alien artifact from the first film.
