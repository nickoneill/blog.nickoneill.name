This is a serious labor of love. Ben Purdy puts together a [scale, keychainable NES cartridge](http://www.benpurdy.com/2012/07/quarter-scale-nes-cartridges/) for his band.

Laser cutting and 3D printing were not quite up to the task (cost, materials, etc) so he milled his own in wax using a drill press on a moving stage and then cast it in resin. Old school methods but absolutely awesome results. You must see it to believe it.
