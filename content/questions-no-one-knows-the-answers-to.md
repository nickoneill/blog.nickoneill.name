Here&apos;s a video of Chris Anderson&apos;s (yes, the WIRED editor) TED Ed talk on questions that no one knows the answer to. The talk consistently touches on curiosity which is conveniently one of my favorite topics.

Even though it deals primarily with unanswered physics questions, I post it here instead of [Fine Structure](http://finestructure.com/) because it&apos;s a basic view of unanswered questions. Scientists have a ton of competing opinions about the details on these unanswered questions - it&apos;s not like no one is trying to answer them - and it&apos;s more useful to know that the questions exist in the first place.
