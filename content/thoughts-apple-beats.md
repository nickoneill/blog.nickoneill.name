Now that the Apple/Beats deal is definitive I thought I would recount an interesting feature of the lengthy rumor discussion that occurred on Twitter over the few weeks of speculation: some people agreed with the acquisition even though all the consequences weren't clear while others were baffled by the whole thing.

The disconnect was pretty fascinating. People that I consider business savvy immediately understood the cultural connection but didn't understand why others were confused about it. Picking on Anil with one example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Weird that people who know a lot about Apple focus more on tech specs of Beats headphones or streaming licenses than their place in culture.</p>&mdash; Anil Dash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/464794841642045440">May 9, 2014</a></blockquote>

The other side (which, I have to admit, was my first reaction as well) was technical users and nerds who mostly expressed inability to understand why the deal happened at all. Lots of reactions like this one:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Let&#39;s drop $3 BILLION on a TERRIBLE accessory instead of something that is actually innovative, like payments / AI / search</p>&mdash; ▵ Jenna Wortham ▵ (@jennydeluxe) <a href="https://twitter.com/jennydeluxe/statuses/464524772257587200">May 8, 2014</a></blockquote>

Yeah? Are we seeing the mismatched questions yet?

On one hand, Apple acquired a company with huge marketing talent and a brand that reaches the cool and young demographic that Apple has been trying to access since the iPod came out. {{% aside %}}disagree? go rewatch some Apple advertisements from the last ten years{{% /aside %}}

But nerds are more product focused. To us, Apple is a company made up of 99% hardware and software engineers who toil endlessly putting together the next generation of lickable devices and after they're totally done some guy with a camera comes in and takes a few shots, someone else throws some marketing copy together and puts it on the website. The tech speaks for itself.

Of course that's not true at all. A significant quantity of Apple is incredibly talented marketing people who also toil endlessly to craft just the right presentation for the stuff that the engineers create. The Beats acquisition has bolstered the invisible team that does so much for the Apple brand and that's what the media people understood immediately.

However, Beats is *still* in the business of producing hardware and the question of where that hardware goes is unanswered. **Continue using the Beats brand as it is?** When has that happened ever in the history of Apple? **Kill the Beats brand and integrate their tech into Apple products new and old?** Doesn't that defeat part of the purpose of buying such a strong brand? And from what I've gleaned, Beats headphones weren't exactly top-of-the-line sound wise anyway. We sure as hell won't be seeing any Android phones branded with internal Beats audio anymore but that's a pretty easy take.

So, even though no one has any idea where or if we'll find Beats technology in upcoming Apple or non-Apple products, the acquisition still had a clear purpose for Apple unlike the nerd outcry might suggest. And the interesting part was watching the two camps - business and nerd - go back and forth, missing what the other was saying for a few days.
