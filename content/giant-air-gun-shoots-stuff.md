I'm not entirely sure what this [giant air gun](http://blog.makezine.com/2012/04/06/vera-super-spud-gun/) is used for ("research", clearly) but the people who built it made an excellent video showing off its capabilities in *slow motion*.

I'm sure there's a good reason to launch things at high speed with "low" acceleration (< 600g) but the author of the video is clearly playing it casual. From the description:

> In the world of ordnance system development the need for system and subsystem testing under dynamic conditions is obvious.

*Obviously*.
