I don't often recommend reading company handbooks but the [Valve company handbook](http://cdn.flamehaus.com/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf) is definitely an exception.

It feels like a bunch of smart nerds got together and ignored all the management advice they were given from every other boilerplate company. Then they made a bunch of awesome games and didn't compromise on their values. Now they're smart rich nerds.
