Who gets hired at Apple? Like any tech giant with great benefits and compensation, Apple has a chance at hiring the best engineers in the pool. That’s the obvious group to focus on if you want to create the best software, this isn’t exactly rocket science.

### Recruitment
To keep this kind of talent around, tech companies focus on recruitment efforts so they can deal with the inevitable loss of existing employees. Just as Apple will look within other companies to poach the best engineers, other companies will be poaching Apple employees with bigger salaries and better compensation packages.

This feels a bit like a short sighted cycle though. Hire great employees, watch great employees leave. Sure, some will stick around out of momentum but, in my experience, these kinds of employees are essentially break-even for the company. They’re not around just for the money (hopefully you’ve cleared those employees out already) but they’re also not the first to jump at trying something new or teaching someone else. You want to hire and retain net-positive employees.

At some point previously, these great employees you hired weren’t as great. Maybe they were doing something completely different or just starting out as engineers. But they became great at some other company and they probably contributed a hell of a lot while they were doing it.

Here’s where I start dealing with intangibles. I think we can all agree that having great people at a company makes the entire company better, moreso than just having great engineers. How do they make the company better exactly? It’s hard to pin down something unquantifiable.

### Experience in anything required
What if companies could identify great people who wanted to do something new? Rather than requiring x years of experience doing exactly the same thing, hire people who have experience doing just about anything well and want to do something else, something in-demand.

Lots of big companies have a week or two of orientation so new employees can get used to the environment. It doesn’t take much to extend that idea to three or six months of intense learning on a new subject, taught by the best engineers the company has to offer.

It’s a chance for the company to extensively evaluate the cultural match for a candidate with the worst case scenario being that they give away free training on their own platform. Otherwise, candidates are hired and start contributing to the company, continuing to learn as they go.

And as a bonus, employees are more likely to stick around if they feel the company gave them a chance that they wouldn’t have otherwise had. A classic psychological effect of feeling in debt from having been given a gift.

### A free lunch, with expectations
I want to be clear here: I’m advocating giving away some serious free lunches. Strictly speaking, the tangible benefits of paying and feeding people for a few months just to teach them something new are almost incalculably small. But would anyone deny that the company gains mindshare at the least, and a class of new, great employees at the most?

This could only happen at a company with a great existing talent pool a willingness to do things a bit different(ly). I think Apple fits this requirement about as close as one can, but it’s applicable to Google or similar companies. Smaller companies probably don’t have the capital for this sort of plan, but they also don’t necessarily see the poaching rates of bigger companies.

And yes, Apple already has an [Apple University](http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/06/apple_university_revealed_as_plan_to_teach_executives_to_think_like_steve_jobs) (or did, at one point in time) but this is a vastly different concept for a far greater number of employees in a different organizational role. And, if you believe the conventional wisdom, it’s a concept that might have a greater overall impact on the company.
