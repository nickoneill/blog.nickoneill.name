Need some help getting ready for Sunday's MSL landing on Mars? [BoingBoing has details](http://boingboing.net/2012/08/02/mars-science-laboratory-rover.html) of all the online NASA livestream events where you can watch the landing (more or less) live.

Landing should occur at 10:31pm Pacific time on Sunday night. It's great timing for the west coast, I might make a little Google hangout for anyone else watching on Sunday.
