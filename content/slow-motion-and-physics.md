Possibly my favorite part of this [montage of dumb things filmed with a high speed camera](http://kottke.org/12/04/slow-motion-stupidity) is the physics.

At 2500fps it gets really obvious that gravity and air resistance play a major role in slowing down fast moving things. Even small pieces of watermelon that are ejected by fireworks get noticeably slower right after the explosion. I won't bother with the kinematics, I'm sure you get all the video analysis you need from [Dot Physics](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/dotphysics/).

I noticed two really fast things in this video, one of which is obvious and the other not so much. Can you guess what they are?
